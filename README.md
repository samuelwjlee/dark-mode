# Project Dark Mode

The purpose of this repo was to try implementing a simple dark mode toggle for the sample mock homeowner page. Simple JavaScript was used to set attribute dark-mode to on or off. There seemed to be two ways of applying dark mode. One is to target each css based on the dark-mode attr and the other was to maintain a global css variable and override them as dark mode gets turned on. Since the purpose of this repo was to quickly try something, I went with the first one.
